# This action's steps must be synced with preMergeRequestCheck Gradle task's checks to ensure that
# we check required stuff on CI and at the same time developers can run the Gradle task to verify their
# changes before making a PR. This action can be used in more workflows than just PR, since these
# basic pre merge request checks (Detekt, library tests, ...) are fundamental to be checked in
# basically all situations like merging, pushing to dev, etc.
